Sometimes I do not find the icon, part design or vector I need so I made one by myself used once and then lost in bytes. So here I will upload several of thems.

I made this for my niece, it is a Doge Dial for car radio. I did not find the line vector I needed so. It has the SVG and the FreeCAD file. You can use it on 3Dparts, laser, plasma, watercut machines and else. Adjust as needed an go.
